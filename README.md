# Deep-Unsupervised-Learning

This repository serves as my practical application for UC Berkeley's [CS294 - Deep Unsupervised Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home) course, with a specific emphasis on generative modeling.

This repository contains:
- Implementations of different variants of the autoregressive model
- My answers for Homeworks 2, 3, and 4
